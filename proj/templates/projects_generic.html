      <h1>Plan-O-Gram</h1>
      <p>
        I was tasked with creating an application that would produce a simple plan-o-gram (a layout used for setup) of items 
        optimally positioned on shelves given various product and shelf dimensions. The product dimensions were stored in a data
        table while shelf levels and dimensions where taken in the form of user input(this would vary as desired by clients). 
        The plan-o-gram would then be used as a guide for the initial setup of products at the client's location. Since the application only 
        needed to be accessible in-network to a few individuals within a small department, I developed the application with PowerShell as this 
        was readily available in their desktop environment, required no additional setup, and would therefore help deliver their application quickly. 
        The program asks the user to point to a file containing a clients desired products (which typically ranges from hundreds to thousands),
        then also takes the client's shelf dimensions. Given those sets of data, it outputs the plan-o-gram.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        This application exemplifies that fact that there are many ways to go about developing any particular solution. It utilizes a PowerShell 
        console and scripts, including a number of methods from the .Net library, and outputs data which is then formatted into an Excel 
        Workbook with Visual Basic.

      <h1>Data Dashboard</h1>
      <p>
        Here is a work in progress of a web dashboard utilizing some data published by various departments of the U.S. Government.
        The front-end is written in JavaScript and the back-end in Python. Data is stored in an Azure SQL database and
        fetched through SQL and Python view functions.

        Additional components to come.
