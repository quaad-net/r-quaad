As shown by the increasing spread between consumption and saving, data suggests that Americans are 
spending more of their income as opposed to saving when compared to years past. The “normalized” 
datasets below show savings, consumption, M1, and CPI on the same scale to give a better view of how 
these move in relation to each other. M1 and CPI have been included due to their potential impacts on 
consumption habits. It should be noted that consumption combined with spending does not account for 
total income (income/property taxes, transfer payments, etc. are not included).
